# 99problems
implementing https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems

This repository is intended to tackle the 99 problems Prolog.

Prolog is a logic language, it is completely different from imperative languages.
I got to know Prolog during my second semester in the University of Bonn.

My goal isn't to just develop 'a solution that works',
but rather achieve an answer that would count as a sample solution,
and also write tests for everything.
I work on this during my free time, which is unfortunately spread thin.
