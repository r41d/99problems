# 99problems
implementing https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems

This repository is intended to tackle the 99 problems Prolog.

Prolog is a logic language, it is completely different from imperative languages.
I got to know Prolog during my second semester in the University of Bonn.

I have some free time at the moment, so I am determined to tackle some of these Prolog problems during my free time.
